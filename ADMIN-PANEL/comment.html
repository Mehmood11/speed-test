        <h4>Pakistan Meeting Challeng of COVID 19</h4>
        <p>
          Globally, corona virus (COVID19) pandemic has become the most
          significant crisis to challenge the health, economy and the wellbeing
          of the humans affecting nearly all the countries. The world
          governments are taking radical mitigation measures to counter the
          health impact of the virus, which on the other hand has severe
          economic and financial consequences on the lives of the people around
          the world. Thus, the COVID-19 has become more than a health crisis for
          all countries with critical social, economic and political
          consequences.
          <br />
          Without exception, like all the countries of the world, Pakistan is
          also hit by the pandemic with an increasing number of confirmed cases
          (see figure below) since February 2020.
          <br />
          Pakistan is the sixth largest populated country in the world with a
          low per capita income of around US$ 1300. The country’s economy is
          mainly dependent on small to medium level manufacturing and service
          industries. Pakistan’s ranking on the Human Development Index (HDI)
          2019 is 152 out of 189 countries, resulting in higher percentage of
          health inequality as compared to the average of South Asian countries.
          Moreover, Pakistan also ranks 105 out of 195 countries on the Global
          Health Security Index 2019, inviting the public health experts to
          question Pakistan's ability to deal with the virus. Pakistan’s Federal
          Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Asad Umar
          at the beginning of April acknowledged and said that
          <b>
            "The rate at which the infection is spreading, we are seeing that
            the limits of our health system will be tested in coming days”</b
          >.
          <br />
          Pakistan has a large public sector health infrastructure that includes
          1201 hospitals, 5518 Basic Health Units, 683 Rural Health Centers,
          5802 Dispensaries, 731 Maternity and Child Health Centers, 347 TB
          communities and 123,394 hospital beds. Furthermore, human resource
          includes around 200,000 doctors, 100,000 nurses and over 95,000 Lady
          Health Workers. The country has launched National Plan on COVID 19,
          which clearly spells out the government’s vision and commitment to
          take unprecedented measure to tackle the situation. The national plan
          outlines and follows the WHO's Strategic Preparedness and Response
          Plan (SPRP) for coronavirus and has greatly helped in limiting the
          spread of the virus to manageable proportions.
          <br />

          The government of Pakistan has set aside a PKR 1.13 trillion ($6.76
          billion) budget to effectively deal with corona crisis. A large part
          of this funding is being spent in health to fight the COVID-19 crisis.
          For example, an amount of PKR 50 billion ($298.94 million) is being
          utilized to procure the clinical hardware only. Pakistan's lab tests
          capacity for corona testing has been increased from 30,000 to 280,000
          and shall be additionally enhanced to 900,000 by May 2020.
